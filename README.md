<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br>
The game ”Des Chiffres et Des Lettres” is a popular intellectual television game in France that has been adapted in other countries under different names. 
<br>
The game requires mathematical skills, linguistic skills, and also some strategic thinking. 
<br>
In this assignment, we are going to implement a training platform to prepare contestant play this game on TV.

<h1>Game rules</h1>
<br>
Each game consists of two rounds: 
<br>
• Letters round
<br>
• Numbers round
<br>
<h3>Letters round</h3>
<br>
The player is given a set of letters one by one. At each step, the player is asked whether a vowel or a consonant should be provided and the computer generates a random letter corresponding to the player’s choice.
<br>
The player will, then, have to use these letters to create the longest valid word. 
<br>
The player must provide his word within a limited amount of time. But this time constraint is waived in this assignment.
<br>
<h3>Numbers round</h3>
Players are given a set of six numbers, typically consisting of small numbers (1-10) and large numbers from the list (25, 50, 75, 100).
<br>
A three-digit target number is randomly generated. Players must use any combination of the random numbers and basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, //) to reach the target number. 
<br>
The closest guess to the target number using valid operations wins.
